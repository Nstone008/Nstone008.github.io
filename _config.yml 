description: [Graduated from Webster University with a degree in Games and Game Design, 
currently has 9 years experience with Unity Game Engine. Over that time I have worked 
on many different projects, from building an arcade cabinet and developing a specific video game, 
"Umami!". To working in different groups for small projects, as well as testing my skill with game jams. 
Currently my main project I have been working on is a title called "Java Saga", originally starting to 
work on it since 2018 with a group of creatives. I'm not the creator of the world of "Java Saga", 
but have been working ot make the concepts come to life and be fun!]
